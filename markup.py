    <p style='font-size: 18px; color: #444;'>Welcome to a tool dedicated to promoting social justice and fairness in company policies! Our app leverages the power of AI to identify and mitigate biases, including racial, gender, and age biases, in your company's policies. It's an entry for the CAPTURETHEWORLD hackathon, and we hope it contributes to a more equitable world.</p>

    <h3 style='color: #777;'>How It Works:</h3>
    <p style='font-size: 16px; color: #555;'><b>Bias Detection:</b> Our app utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo language model and LangChain to analyze your company policies. It identifies bias sentences within the text and categorizes them by type (e.g., racial, gender, age biases).</p>
    
    <p style='font-size: 16px; color: #555;'><b>Mitigation Suggestions:</b> Once bias sentences are detected, the app sends them back to the AI model to generate unbiased suggestions. These suggestions can help you rewrite the biased sentences in a fair and inclusive manner.</p>

    <p style='font-size: 16px; color: #555;'><b>Analytics:</b> Our app provides analytics, including an overall unbiased score, bias percentages for each bias category, both numerically and visually. You can gain insights into the extent of biases in your policies and track improvements over time.</p>
    
    <h3 style='color: #777;'>Get Started:</h3>
    <p style='font-size: 16px; color: #555;'>Use the app by simply pasting the policy text you want to check into the provided text box or upload a PDF of the policy. Click the "Analyze" button to begin the bias detection and mitigation process. It's that easy!</p>
